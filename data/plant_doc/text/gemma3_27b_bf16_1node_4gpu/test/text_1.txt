Two leaves are visible against a white background. Both leaves exhibit an ovate shape with serrated margins. One leaf displays a predominantly green coloration with numerous, irregularly shaped brown spots distributed across its surface. These spots vary in size and some appear slightly raised. The second leaf shows a gradient of color, transitioning from green at the base to yellow and brown towards the tip and edges. This leaf also has several brown spots, some merging to form larger discolored areas. Veins are visible on both leaves, with some appearing slightly darker than the surrounding leaf tissue. The petioles are slender and brownish.
