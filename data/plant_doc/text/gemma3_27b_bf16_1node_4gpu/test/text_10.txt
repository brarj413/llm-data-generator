A single leaf is visible against a light-colored background. The leaf is ovate with a pointed apex and a smooth margin, though portions of the margin appear darkened and slightly curled. The leaf exhibits a mottled coloration, with areas of green transitioning to reddish-brown and dark brown. Numerous small, irregularly shaped dark brown to black spots are densely distributed across much of the leaf surface, particularly concentrated towards the center and along the veins. Some spots appear slightly raised or textured. The central vein is visible and extends to the base of the leaf. The petiole is thin and dark brown.  The areas of discoloration and spotting are more pronounced towards the distal end of the leaf.
