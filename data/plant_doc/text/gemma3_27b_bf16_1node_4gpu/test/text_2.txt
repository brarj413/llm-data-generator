A single leaf and a small stem section are visible, alongside a portion of a white object in the background. The leaf is broadly ovate with a pointed apex and an uneven margin exhibiting both smooth and serrated edges. The leaf displays a mottled appearance with areas of dark green interspersed with lighter green and brownish discoloration. Numerous irregularly shaped, dark brown to black markings are scattered across the leaf surface, concentrated towards the distal end. Some areas along the margin show signs of drying and browning. The stem is slender and reddish-brown, supporting a small, reddish-purple, spherical structure.  A second, smaller leaf is present, exhibiting similar discoloration and browning at its tip.
