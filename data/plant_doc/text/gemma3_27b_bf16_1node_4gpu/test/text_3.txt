A single leaf is prominently displayed against a blurred green background. The leaf is broadly ovate with a pointed apex and a serrated margin. Its coloration is predominantly green, but exhibits irregular patches of brown and reddish-brown discoloration. These discolored areas are distributed across the leaf surface, with some coalescing along the veins, and others appearing as smaller, scattered spots. The brown areas have somewhat diffuse edges and vary in intensity. Some portions of the leaf margin also display a brownish hue. The leaf surface appears relatively smooth, though the discoloration introduces textural variation.
