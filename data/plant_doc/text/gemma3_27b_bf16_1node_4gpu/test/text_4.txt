A single leaf is visible, displaying an ovate shape with a pointed apex and serrated margins. The leaf’s coloration is predominantly green, but is heavily mottled with areas of lighter and darker green. Numerous, irregularly shaped dark brown to black markings are distributed across the leaf surface, varying in size from pinpoint to approximately 5mm in diameter. Some of these markings appear slightly raised and have reddish-purple halos. The venation is visible as slightly raised lines. The leaf surface appears generally smooth, though the markings disrupt this texture. Browning and discoloration are concentrated towards the leaf margins, with some areas appearing necrotic.
