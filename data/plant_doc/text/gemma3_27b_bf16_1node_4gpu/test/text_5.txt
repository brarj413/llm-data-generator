The image presents several ovate leaves attached to slender, green stems. Leaf color varies from light to dark green, with noticeable mottling on some surfaces. Several leaves exhibit irregularly shaped, brownish-grey markings concentrated towards the lower portions and along veins. These markings appear somewhat textured and are not uniformly distributed. The leaf margins are serrated, and some leaves display a slight curling or distortion. The overall leaf texture appears smooth, though the markings introduce some surface variation. The stems are thin and green, with no obvious lesions or discolorations visible. The background is a uniform blue.
