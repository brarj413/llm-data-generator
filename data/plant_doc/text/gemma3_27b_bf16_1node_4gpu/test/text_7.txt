A single leaf is visible, displaying a predominantly green hue with areas of yellowing. Multiple irregularly shaped, darkened patches are present on the leaf surface, ranging in size from small spots to larger blotches. These darkened areas exhibit varying shades of brown and purple. Some patches are surrounded by a faint yellow halo. The leaf margin appears somewhat uneven and slightly curled in places. Veins are discernible, running throughout the leaf blade. The leaf texture appears relatively smooth, though details are somewhat obscured by the patches. The overall leaf shape is broadly ovate.
