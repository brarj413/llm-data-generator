A single leaf and portions of surrounding foliage are visible, held against a blurred background. The leaf is ovate with a pointed apex and serrated margins. Its coloration is highly variable; the distal portion exhibits extensive dark brown to black, irregularly shaped patches, with surrounding areas of yellowing. Closer to the leaf base, a mottled pattern of green and yellow is present. Some areas display small, dark reddish-brown spots. The leaf surface appears generally smooth, though the affected areas are somewhat textured. A portion of a hand is visible, holding the leaf. Other leaves in the background show similar, though less pronounced, discoloration.
