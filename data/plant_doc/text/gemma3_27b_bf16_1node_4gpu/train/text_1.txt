Several rounded fruits, predominantly red with areas of yellow-green, are visible amongst green leaves. The leaves exhibit varying shades of green, with some showing yellowing. One leaf displays numerous dark, irregularly shaped blotches, transitioning to gray in some areas, covering a significant portion of its surface. These blotches appear slightly raised and have indistinct edges. The leaf margins are serrated. A branch, appearing brownish-gray, supports the fruits and leaves. Small, dark spots are present on the surface of one of the fruits. The leaves have a smooth texture and an ovate shape.
