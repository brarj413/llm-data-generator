A single leaf is prominently displayed alongside a portion of a hand for scale. The leaf is broadly ovate with a pointed apex and a smooth margin. The upper surface exhibits a mottled appearance, transitioning from green to yellowish-brown, particularly towards the edges. Numerous small, irregularly shaped dark purple to brown spots are scattered across the leaf surface, becoming more concentrated towards the lower portion. Some of these spots appear slightly raised and are surrounded by a faint yellow halo. Veins are visible, appearing slightly darker green than the surrounding leaf tissue. The leaf exhibits some curling along the edges.
