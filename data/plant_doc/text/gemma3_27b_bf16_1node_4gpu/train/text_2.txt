A single, green leaf is prominently displayed, exhibiting an ovate shape with a pointed apex. The leaf surface appears generally smooth with visible venation. Irregular, brownish-grey patches are present on the lower portion of the leaf, extending along some of the veins. These patches are somewhat diffuse and not sharply defined. The leaf margin shows slight serrations. A smaller, similarly shaped leaf is partially visible behind the main leaf, also displaying a green coloration. The leaf appears relatively thin and somewhat pliable. The petiole is a lighter green color than the leaf blade.
