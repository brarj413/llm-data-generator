A single green leaf is visible, displaying a textured surface with prominent veins. Two irregularly shaped, brownish-red areas are present on the leaf surface, appearing slightly raised and granular in texture. These areas are clustered near a central vein and measure approximately 3-5 millimeters in diameter. The leaf margin is serrated, with small, pointed teeth. The leaf exhibits a generally oval shape, and the overall coloration is a vibrant green, though slightly paler near the central vein. Fine, translucent structures, possibly webbing, are visible on the leaf surface. The leaf appears otherwise intact, with no significant distortions or discoloration beyond the described areas.
