A single, light green leaf is prominently featured, with a partially visible, rounded green fruit adjacent to it. The leaf exhibits numerous irregularly shaped, reddish-brown markings concentrated along the leaf veins and extending towards the margins. These markings vary in size and intensity, some appearing as small spots, others forming larger blotches. The leaf margin is serrated, and the leaf surface appears generally smooth, although texture detail is limited by image resolution. A portion of a branch, light brown in color, is visible supporting the leaf and fruit. Some areas of the leaf show a lighter green hue, particularly near the base.
