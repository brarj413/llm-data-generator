Three leaves are visible, attached to a slender, dark brown stem. The leaves are ovate to elliptical in shape, with serrated margins. Leaf color varies across the sample; two leaves exhibit a predominantly green hue, while the third displays significant discoloration. This leaf features large areas of reddish-brown and yellowing, particularly towards the edges and along portions of the veins. Scattered across all three leaves are small, irregularly shaped spots ranging in color from yellow to dark brown. Some of these spots have a reddish halo. The leaf surfaces appear generally smooth, though the discolored areas exhibit a slightly wrinkled texture. The stem appears smooth and cylindrical.
