The image displays several green leaves with varying degrees of discoloration and markings. Most leaves are ovate with serrated margins and visible veins. Some leaves exhibit patches of yellowing, particularly near the edges, transitioning into brown areas. Multiple leaves have distinct, irregularly shaped dark brown to black spots, some with lighter halos surrounding them. These spots are scattered across the leaf surfaces. The stems appear reddish-purple and are sparsely covered with fine hairs. A small, dark-colored insect is visible on one of the stems. The leaf texture appears generally smooth, though some exhibit slight wrinkling.
