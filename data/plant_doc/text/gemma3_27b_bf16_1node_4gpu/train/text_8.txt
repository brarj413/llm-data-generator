A single leaf is prominently displayed against a blurred green background. The leaf is broadly ovate with a slightly undulating margin, exhibiting a vibrant green coloration overall, though uneven in tone. Numerous irregularly shaped patches of discoloration are present across the leaf surface. These areas range in color from pale yellow to dark brown and black. Some discolorations appear as roughly circular spots with indistinct edges, while others are more diffuse and blotchy. Several of the darker areas exhibit a slightly raised texture. Veins are visible, appearing slightly darker green than the surrounding leaf tissue. The leaf’s apex is pointed, and minor damage is apparent along the edges with small sections missing.
