The image shows a section of a plant with multiple green leaves and developing, rounded fruits. Leaves exhibit varying shades of green, with some displaying irregular patches of yellowing and dark brown to black, somewhat circular markings. These darker markings are present both on the leaf surfaces and on the surfaces of the fruits. Some leaf margins appear slightly curled or distorted. The stems are brown and slender, supporting the leaves and fruits. The dark markings on the leaves are somewhat raised and appear clustered in some areas, while others are more scattered. The fruits are pale green with similar dark markings as observed on the leaves.
