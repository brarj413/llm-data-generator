The image shows two leaves with visible signs of disease. The leaf on the left has numerous brown spots scattered across its surface, which are indicative of a fungal infection. The leaf on the right has larger brown areas, suggesting a more severe or advanced stage of the disease. To identify the specific disease, I would need more information about the plant species and the environment where the leaves were found. Common diseases that cause such symptoms include leaf spot diseases caused by fungi such as Cercospora or Alternaria. Proper diagnosis would require a closer examination by a plant pathologist or a laboratory test.
