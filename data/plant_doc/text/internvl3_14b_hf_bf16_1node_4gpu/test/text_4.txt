This leaf exhibits symptoms of a fungal or bacterial disease, likely a form of leaf spot or rust. The dark spots, which can be circular or irregular in shape, are common signs of such infections. These spots may be surrounded by a yellow halo, indicating the plant's response to the infection. The presence of these spots can lead to reduced photosynthesis, stunted growth, and, in severe cases, premature leaf drop. Addressing this issue involves improving air circulation around the plant, removing and destroying affected leaves, and applying appropriate fungicides or bactericides if necessary.
