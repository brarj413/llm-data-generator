This leaf has several dark, circular spots, which are likely indicative of a fungal infection. The spots may be caused by a disease such as anthracnose, which affects many types of trees and shrubs. The best course of action would be to remove and destroy the infected leaves to prevent the spread of the fungus. Additionally, applying a fungicide and ensuring proper tree care, such as adequate watering and pruning, can help manage the disease.
