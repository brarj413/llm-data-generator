This appears to be a leaf with signs of disease or pest damage. The spots and discoloration could indicate a fungal infection, such as leaf spot disease, or possibly insect damage. It would be helpful to know more about the plant species and the environmental conditions to provide a more accurate diagnosis. If you suspect a fungal infection, removing affected leaves and improving air circulation around the plant can help manage the issue.
