It looks like the leaves on the tree are showing signs of a disease or pest infestation. The spots and discoloration could be caused by various factors such as fungal infections, bacterial diseases, or insect damage. It's important to identify the specific cause to determine the appropriate treatment. I recommend consulting with a local agricultural extension office or a certified arborist for a proper diagnosis and advice on how to treat the tree.
