This leaf shows symptoms of a common plant disease known as black spot or leaf spot. It is characterized by dark, circular spots with a yellowish halo on the leaves. These spots can cause the leaves to turn yellow and fall off, potentially weakening the plant. The disease is often caused by fungal infections and can be managed by removing affected leaves, improving air circulation, and applying fungicides if necessary.
