This image shows a plant with leaves that appear to be affected by a disease, likely a fungal infection such as black spot or blight. The leaves have dark spots and are turning yellow, which can be indicative of a lack of nutrients or water stress. The fruit also shows signs of damage, with dark spots that could be from the same disease. To address this, you should consider the following steps:

1. **Prune Affected Areas**: Remove all affected leaves and fruit to prevent the spread of the disease.
2. **Improve Air Circulation**: Ensure the plant is not overcrowded and has good air circulation around it.
3. **Water Properly**: Water at the base of the plant to avoid wetting the foliage, which can encourage fungal growth.
4. **Use Fungicide**: Apply a fungicide as a preventative measure, especially if the disease is widespread.
5. **Fertilize**: Check soil pH and nutrient levels and fertilize if necessary to promote plant health.
6. **Monitor Regularly**: Keep an eye on the plant for any further signs of disease or stress.

If the disease persists, consider consulting a local agricultural extension service or a plant pathologist for a more specific diagnosis and treatment plan.
