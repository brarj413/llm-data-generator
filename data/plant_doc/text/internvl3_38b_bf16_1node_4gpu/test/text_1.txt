The image shows two leaves with noticeable spots and discoloration, which are typical symptoms of leaf diseases. Here are a few possibilities:

1. **Fungal Infection**: The brown spots could indicate a fungal infection, such as anthracnose or rust. These fungi often cause spots and can lead to yellowing and browning of leaves.

2. **Bacterial Infection**: Bacterial leaf spot is another possibility. It typically presents as small, circular spots that may be brown, black, or yellow.

3. **Viral Infection**: Viral infections can cause mottling and discoloration, but they often involve more systemic symptoms.

4. **Environmental Stress**: Overwatering, nutrient deficiencies, or sunburn can also cause similar symptoms, including browning and yellowing.

For accurate diagnosis, consider factors like plant species, environmental conditions, and recent weather patterns. If the issue persists or worsens, consulting a local agricultural extension service or plant pathologist is advisable.
