The leaf in the image shows signs of disease, likely fungal infection. The dark spots suggest a condition such as anthracnose or leaf blight. These diseases are often caused by fungi and can be managed by:

1. **Pruning**: Remove affected leaves to prevent spread.
2. **Sanitation**: Clear fallen leaves and debris.
3. **Fungicides**: Apply appropriate fungicides if necessary.
4. **Watering**: Avoid overhead watering to reduce moisture on leaves.

Ensure proper plant care and monitor for further symptoms.
