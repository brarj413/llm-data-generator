The leaf in the image shows signs of a disease, likely a fungal infection. The dark spots and overall discoloration suggest a common issue such as apple scab, which affects apple and crabapple trees. This disease is caused by the fungus *Venturia inaequalis* and results in olive-green spots that can turn dark and spread, leading to leaf distortion and early leaf drop.

To manage apple scab:

1. **Cultural Control**: Remove and destroy infected leaves and fruit to reduce spore spread.
2. **Pruning**: Improve air circulation by pruning to help leaves dry faster after rain.
3. **Fungicides**: Apply fungicides in early spring before buds open, following local guidelines and product instructions.
4. **Resistant Varieties**: Consider planting resistant cultivars if recurring issues are present.

Consult a local extension service or a plant disease clinic for a precise diagnosis and tailored management plan.
