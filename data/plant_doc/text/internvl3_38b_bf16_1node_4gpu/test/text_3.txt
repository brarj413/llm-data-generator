The leaf in the image shows signs of a common fungal disease known as "leaf spot." This condition typically presents as brown or black spots on the leaves, which can vary in size and may merge to form larger patches. It's often caused by fungi such as Septoria or Alternaria. 

To manage leaf spot:

1. **Remove Affected Leaves**: Prune and dispose of infected leaves to reduce the spread.
2. **Improve Air Circulation**: Ensure adequate spacing between plants to improve airflow.
3. **Water Management**: Avoid overhead watering to keep foliage dry.
4. **Fungicides**: Consider using fungicides if the infection is severe, following label instructions.

Regular monitoring and good garden hygiene can help prevent the spread of this disease.
