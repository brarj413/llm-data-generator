This leaf exhibits symptoms of a fungal disease known as black spot, commonly affecting plants like roses. The dark spots are often surrounded by yellow halos, indicating areas where the fungus has infected the leaf tissue. The disease thrives in warm, humid conditions and can be managed by improving air circulation, removing infected leaves, and applying fungicides if necessary. It's important to ensure the plant is well-maintained and avoid overhead watering to prevent the spread of the fungus.
