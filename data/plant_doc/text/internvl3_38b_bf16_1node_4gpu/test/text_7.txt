The leaf in the image shows signs of fungal infection, possibly anthracnose or a similar disease. Symptoms include dark, circular spots and yellowing around the affected areas. This is often caused by fungi that thrive in warm, wet conditions. To manage:

1. **Remove and Destroy Affected Leaves**: Prevent the spread by removing infected leaves.
2. **Improve Air Circulation**: Prune surrounding branches to increase airflow.
3. **Water Carefully**: Avoid overhead watering to keep foliage dry.
4. **Fungicides**: Use as directed if the infection is severe.

Consider consulting a local extension service for specific treatment advice based on your region.
