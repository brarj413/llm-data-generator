The leaf shows signs of a fungal or bacterial infection, likely leaf spot disease. The spots are irregular and vary in color from greenish-yellow to brown, indicating damage to the leaf tissue. To address this issue, you can:

1. **Remove Affected Leaves**: Prune and dispose of the infected leaves to prevent the spread.
2. **Improve Air Circulation**: Ensure the plant is not overcrowded and has good air circulation.
3. **Water Carefully**: Avoid overhead watering; water at the base to keep foliage dry.
4. **Use Fungicides**: Consider using a suitable fungicide if the infection is severe.
5. **Monitor Regularly**: Check the plant frequently for new signs of disease.

These steps can help manage and prevent further spread of the disease.
