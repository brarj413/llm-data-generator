The leaf in the image is showing signs of a fungal infection, likely black spot disease, which is common in apple trees. This condition is characterized by dark, circular spots on the leaves. To manage it, ensure proper air circulation around the tree by pruning overcrowded branches, remove and destroy affected leaves, and consider using a fungicide if the infection is severe. Watering at the base of the plant rather than overhead can also help prevent the spread of the fungus.
