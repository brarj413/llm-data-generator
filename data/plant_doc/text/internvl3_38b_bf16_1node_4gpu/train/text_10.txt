The leaf shows signs of a fungal or bacterial infection, possibly due to a disease like leaf spot. The discolored spots and yellowing suggest it's not receiving adequate nutrients or is under stress. Ensure the plant is in well-draining soil, avoid overhead watering, and consider using a fungicide if the issue persists. Pruning affected leaves can also help prevent spread.
