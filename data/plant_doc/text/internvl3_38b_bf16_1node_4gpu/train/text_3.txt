This image shows a leaf with noticeable discoloration, which could be indicative of a disease or pest issue. The yellowing and spots suggest a possible fungal infection, such as apple scab, common in apple trees. The presence of small green fruits supports this possibility. To address the issue, it's advisable to:

1. **Inspect the Tree**: Check other leaves and fruits for similar symptoms.
2. **Improve Air Circulation**: Prune to reduce overcrowding and improve airflow.
3. **Fungicide Application**: Consider using a fungicide if the infection is widespread.
4. **Sanitation**: Remove and dispose of affected leaves and fruits to prevent spread.

If unsure, consult a local agricultural extension service for specific advice tailored to your region.
