The image shows a leaf with signs of a common plant disease, possibly apple scab, which is caused by the fungus Venturia inaequalis. This disease typically affects apple trees and is characterized by olive-green to brown lesions on the leaves and fruit. The spots can have a velvety texture and may enlarge over time. Managing apple scab involves cultural practices like pruning to improve air circulation, removing infected plant debris, and applying fungicides if necessary. Early detection and prevention are key to controlling the spread of the fungus.
