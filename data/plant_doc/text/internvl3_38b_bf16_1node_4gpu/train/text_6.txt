The leaves in the image show signs of a common leaf disease, possibly black spot or a similar fungal infection. These conditions often manifest as dark spots with yellow halos and can lead to leaf damage and defoliation if untreated. To manage this issue:

1. **Improve Air Circulation**: Ensure plants are spaced properly to reduce humidity around leaves.
2. **Watering**: Avoid overhead watering to keep leaves dry.
3. **Sanitation**: Remove and destroy infected leaves to prevent spread.
4. **Fungicides**: Consider using fungicides as a preventive measure in early stages, following label instructions.

Regular monitoring and early intervention are key to managing such diseases effectively.
