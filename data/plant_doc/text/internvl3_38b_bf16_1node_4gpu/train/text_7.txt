The image shows leaves with dark spots and discoloration, which are symptoms of a plant disease. This could be indicative of a fungal infection such as apple scab, which affects apple and crabapple trees. The dark lesions and yellowing suggest the presence of a pathogen that targets the leaves, leading to reduced photosynthesis and potential defoliation if untreated.

To manage this issue:

1. **Identify the Disease**: Confirm the disease through proper diagnosis, possibly consulting a local agricultural extension service.
2. **Cultural Controls**: Remove and destroy affected leaves to reduce the spread of the pathogen. Ensure good air circulation by pruning overcrowded branches.
3. **Chemical Controls**: Apply fungicides as per local guidelines and timing recommendations, usually before symptoms appear or in early stages.
4. **Resistant Varieties**: Consider planting disease-resistant varieties if recurring issues persist.
5. **Sanitation**: Clean up fallen leaves and debris to minimize overwintering sites for the fungus.

These steps can help mitigate the impact of the disease and promote healthier plant growth.
