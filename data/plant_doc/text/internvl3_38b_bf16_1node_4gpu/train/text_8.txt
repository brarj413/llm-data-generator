The leaf in the image shows signs of a fungal disease, likely a type of leaf spot. The dark, irregular spots with lighter centers suggest a common issue such as black spot or anthracnose. These diseases are often caused by fungi and can be exacerbated by moist conditions.

### Management Tips:
1. **Pruning**: Remove and destroy affected leaves to prevent the spread.
2. **Water Management**: Avoid overhead watering to keep foliage dry.
3. **Fungicides**: Apply appropriate fungicides if necessary, following local guidelines.
4. **Sanitation**: Clean up garden debris to reduce overwintering sites for the fungus.
5. **Spacing**: Ensure proper spacing for good air circulation.

Regular monitoring and early intervention are key to managing and preventing the spread of such diseases.
