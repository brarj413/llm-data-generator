Two leaves are presented, each exhibiting distinct visual characteristics. The leaf on the left is predominantly green with numerous small, round, brown spots scattered across its surface. The leaf on the right displays a more extensive area of browning, particularly concentrated in the central region, with some green areas remaining along the edges. Both leaves have serrated margins and appear to have a smooth texture. The brown areas on both leaves vary in intensity, with some regions showing darker, almost blackened spots. The veins of the leaves are visible and appear to be unaffected by the discoloration, maintaining a consistent green color.
