The image shows a single leaf attached to a thin, dark stem. The leaf is elongated with a smooth margin and a pointed tip, exhibiting an overall green color with significant discoloration. Numerous small, dark brown to black spots are scattered across the leaf surface, varying in size and shape. Some areas of the leaf display a reddish hue, particularly along the edges. The leaf's texture appears smooth, with no visible hairs or significant wrinkling. The spots are primarily concentrated towards the center and upper regions of the leaf, with some clustering observed. The underside of the leaf is not visible in the image.
