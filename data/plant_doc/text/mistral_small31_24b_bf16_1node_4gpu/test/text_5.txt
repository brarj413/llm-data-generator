The image displays several leaves attached to a stem. The leaves are primarily green with notable yellowing, particularly concentrated along the veins and extending into the leaf tissue. The yellowing appears irregular and is more pronounced on some leaves than others. The leaf margins are serrated, and the overall shape is ovate with a pointed tip. The leaf surfaces appear smooth, with no visible texture variations. Some leaves exhibit slight curling along the edges. The stem is thin, green, and shows no visible anomalies. The background is a solid blue color, providing a clear contrast to the leaves and stem.
