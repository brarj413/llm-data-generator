The image shows a close-up of several leaves held in a hand. The leaves are predominantly green with a textured, bumpy surface. There are noticeable variations in color, including areas of yellowing and some brown spots scattered across the leaves. The leaf margins appear smooth, and the veins are prominent, creating a network pattern across the leaf surface. Some areas exhibit a more pronounced yellowing along the veins, while other regions show irregular brown patches. The leaf edges are slightly curled, and there are small, dark specks present in some of the brown areas. The overall appearance of the leaves suggests a mix of healthy and affected regions.
