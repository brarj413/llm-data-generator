The image shows a close-up of a fruit and several leaves. The fruit is round, predominantly red with some yellowish-green patches, and has a smooth texture. There are small, dark, circular spots on its surface. The leaves are ovate with serrated margins and exhibit a mix of green and yellow colors. One leaf prominently displays numerous dark, irregularly shaped spots with a slightly raised texture, scattered across its surface. The leaf veins are visible, and the overall leaf texture appears slightly wrinkled. The background includes additional fruits and leaves, all appearing similarly affected.
