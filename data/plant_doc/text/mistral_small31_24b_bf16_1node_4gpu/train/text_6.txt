The image shows a cluster of three leaves attached to a stem. The leaves are ovate with serrated margins and a pointed tip. The upper surface of the leaves is predominantly green with several irregularly shaped yellow and brown spots scattered across them. Some spots have a darker center and a lighter halo. The texture of the leaves appears smooth, and the veins are clearly visible. The stem is thin, green, and shows no visible anomalies. The background is plain and does not interfere with the visibility of the plant parts.
