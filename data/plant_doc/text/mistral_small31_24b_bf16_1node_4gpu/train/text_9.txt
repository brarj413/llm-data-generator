The image shows several leaves attached to a branch. The leaves exhibit a mix of green and yellow coloring, with some areas appearing brown and necrotic. There are dark, irregularly shaped spots scattered across the leaf surfaces, some of which have a slightly raised texture. The leaves are ovate with serrated margins and a smooth texture, although some appear wrinkled. The branch is thin, brown, and bears small nodes where the leaves are attached. The overall appearance of the leaves suggests varying degrees of discoloration and tissue damage.
