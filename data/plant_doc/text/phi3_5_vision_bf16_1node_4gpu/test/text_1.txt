The image presents two leaves, each exhibiting signs of damage or disease. The left leaf is predominantly green with a pattern of brown spots and holes, suggesting a possible infestation or decay. The right leaf shows a more advanced stage of deterioration, with a significant portion of the leaf's surface covered in brown spots and holes, and the edges appear to be curling or wilting. The background is plain white, which contrasts with the leaves and highlights their condition.
