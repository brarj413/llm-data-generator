The image shows two leaves with distinct visual characteristics. The leaf on the left is predominantly green with a slightly elongated, ovate shape and a smooth margin. It displays multiple small to medium-sized, irregularly shaped brown spots scattered across its surface, some of which appear slightly raised or textured. The leaf on the right is also green but exhibits a more pronounced yellowish-green hue, particularly towards the edges. This leaf has larger, more concentrated brown patches, which appear darker and more pronounced, especially near the central portion. The stems of both leaves are slender and light brown, extending downward from the leaves. The background is plain white, and there are no visible stems, flowers, or fruits in the image. The overall texture of both leaves seems smooth, with no apparent hairiness or wrinkling.
