The image shows a close-up of a leaf held by a hand. The leaf is predominantly green with noticeable discoloration, including patches of yellow and brown in various areas. The green regions appear healthy, while the affected areas display a mottled pattern with irregular shapes and sizes. Some sections of the leaf have a darker, almost necrotic appearance, particularly along the veins and margins. The texture of the leaf seems smooth, and the veins are clearly visible, with the discoloration often concentrated along or near them. The leaf margins are serrated, and the overall leaf shape is elongated and slightly ovate. The background includes additional green foliage, but the focus remains on the leaf being held.
