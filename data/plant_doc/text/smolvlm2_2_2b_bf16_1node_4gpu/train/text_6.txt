The image shows three green leaves with a central stem. The leaves have a smooth texture and are oval in shape with pointed tips. There are several small brown spots and patches on the leaves, indicating some degree of damage or disease. The veins of the leaves are clearly visible and the petioles are short and green. The background is a plain white surface, which contrasts with the green leaves.
